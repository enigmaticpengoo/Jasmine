My first fullstack project (MERN)

Jasmine is a social media platform. It doesn't have any fancy bells or whistles, it was just
my attempt at building something and seeing if I could do it. The project is mostly complete
and I am proud of where its at.

The following features currently exist...
Account creation with usename, password, and profile picture upload
Posts can be made by logged in users
Users can be searched
Users can go to other user's profile pages containing their name, profile pic,
cover photo, and feed of their posts
Users can follow and unfollow other users, and see the count displayed
(the backend also tracks who follows who but I haven't gotten around to using that information yet)
Logged in users can see a feed of posts from only users they are following
Posts can be liked and commented (just don't try to comment on a comment yet)

I'm sure I made plenty of mistakes, but I just kept pressing forward to get it to where it's at now.
It was a great experience to see how technology really works behind the scenes and I now have
a far greater understanding of software development and how software works.

Thanks for stopping by, have a great day!
